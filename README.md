README for Random NPC Generator

-------------------------------

Purpose and Description


The purpose of the Random NPC Generator is to provide a starting point for new character generation. The main uses would be for developing a new character especially during the brainstorming process, for designing a character such as during a Dungeons and Dragons campagin, or for the generation of new NPCs in the creation of a game.  In particular, we wanted to make a generator that is diverse and accounts for a wider range of human characteristics above and beyond the options that are typically offered in most games. Specifically, that includes options for different genders, allows for intersex characters, and a variety of different hair and skin options.

The NPC Generator is based in Unity (version 2017.3.0f3) and it can be run either through the browser through the use of Java-based OpenGL as well as through a Desktop application (Available on both MacOS and Windows). Upon starting up the program,  you will be able to generate a character with randomized statistics. You can then click through each tab to see the complete list of character details. To generate a new character, simply hit the New button. To exit the program, Back out to the Title screen and then hit Exit. The Escape key will also work. 

Please note that the Esc and Exit keys will not work in the browser version. This has to do with the nature of browser web applications. To leave, simply navigate to a new page.

Current Status


The project is currently in its early development stages, and additional features will be implemented as time and resources permit.

* Currently as of 01/12/18, the game can generate a random NPC with a number of face, gender, and sexuality options. Saving of the data is not possible excpet via screenshot. 


-------------------------------
Future Features


In the future, we would like to implement a number of features including:

* Save and export character information:
  Specifically, we would like the data to be exported in an easy to use text file.  
  
* Specific stat re-rolling:
  Allows the rerolling of any specific stat. Will allow for further customization.

* Background music and sound effects:
  For a more fun/enjoyable experience, we would like to include sound effects (with the options to turn them on/off).
 
* Stat/characteristic descriptions and/or illustrations:
  We would like to include some descriptions or explanations about each of the character statistics. 
  
* Voice overs:
  To allow for easier accessibility, we would like to include voice overs for the text and categories.
